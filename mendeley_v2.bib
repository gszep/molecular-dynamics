Three bootstrap methods are supported: (i) bootstrapping new trajectories based on the umbrella histograms, (ii) bootstrapping of complete histograms, and (iii) Bayesian bootstrapping of complete histograms, that is, bootstrapping via the assignment of random weights to the histograms. Because methods ii and iii consider only complete histograms as independent data points, these methods do not require the accurate calculation of autocorrelation times. We demonstrate that, given sufficient sampling, bootstrapping new trajectories allows for an accurate error estimate. In the presence of long autocorrelations, however, (Bayesian) bootstrapping of complete histograms yields a more reliable error estimate, whereas bootstrapping of new trajectories may underestimate the error. In addition, we emphasize that the incorporation of autocorrelations into WHAM reduces the bias from limited sampling, in particular, when computing periodic PMFs in inhomogeneous systems such as solvated lipid membranes or protein channels.

abstract = {3 Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane (OM) besides the cytoplasmic one. Both membranes are revealed in the cell envelope structure of Gram-negative bacteria by electron microscopy of thin sections. Such a complex cell wall structure is a result of the living conditions of these bacteria. Most often than not, it is a hypotonic environment capable of inducing the lysis of the cytoplasmic membrane. For example, bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae inhabiting human intestines must possess some mechanism of cytoplasmic membrane protection from the detergent effect of bile acids, fatty acids, and glycerides. Besides, the intestinal cavity is rich in proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes and glycosides [1]. Predominant proteins of bacterial OM are integral $\beta$-structured proteins, nonspecific porins, intended for passive diffusion of hydrophilic molecules with the molecular weight of no more than 600 Da. They form transmembrane water-filled channels (or pores) that provide the exchange of low-molecular substances between cell and environment. One of these proteins, named porin, was revealed in 1976 in the OM of Escherichia coli [2]. Later on, this term was used to designate the entire class of proteins forming diffusion channels in OM and responsible for nonspecific transport of small hydrophilic molecules involved in bacterial metabolism [3]. The data on the basic properties of nonspecific pore-forming proteins (porins) of E. coli and specific channels (LamB) for maltose transport, as well as on the asymmetric structure of outer lipid bilayer, were available already in the middle of the 1980s of the last century [4]. The above-mentioned asymmetry results from the circumstance that the inner OM layer consists of phospholipids, while the outer layer is formed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This fact explains the abnormally low permeability of the membrane for lipophilic substances. The subsequent 20 years were characterized by a very rapid (sometimes burst-like) accumulation of knowledge on the structure and function of por-ins. The process of diffusion of low-molecular substances through nonspecific and specific porin channels has been described in detail at the molecular level owing to the data on the crystal structure of these proteins. As a result of identification of an ample quantity of various genome sequences, such pore-forming proteins with the transport function were revealed in many microorganisms besides enterobacteria. In some cases, it threw light on the characteristic physiological features of different organisms under natural living conditions. As expected, porins were found in all of the studied species of Gram-negative bacteria and even in a separate group of Gram-positive bacteria with the cell wall abundant in lipids like a bilayer. This group included corynebacteria, mycobacteria, and nocardii (Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, Nocardia). Mito-chondrial porins (voltage-dependent anion channels, VDAC) were discovered a few years later [5]. Their spatial structure is similar to the structure of nonspe-REVIEWS Abstract-The structure and functional properties of nonspecific porins ($\beta$-structured integral proteins of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria) are overviewed. The characteristic features of porin spatial structure related to the principles of $\beta$-barrel construction and pore geometry are considered. The data concerning nonspecific diffusion of low-molecular substances and dynamic behavior of porin channels dependent on the distribution of charged amino acid residues in different structural domains of the porin molecule are presented. The methods and approaches used in the study of functional activity of porins are surveyed. The data on modulation of pore-forming activity of these proteins by external factors and membrane components are considered separately.},

@article{Benz1985,
abstract = {Twelve different porins from the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Yersinia pestis were reconstituted into lipid bilayer membranes. Most of the porins, except outer membrane protein P, formed large, water-filled, ion-permeable channels with a single-channel conductance between 1.5 and 6 nS in 1 M KCl. The ions used for probing the pore structure had the same relative mobilities while moving through the porin pore as they did while moving in free solution. Thus the single-channel conductances of the individual porins could be used to estimate the effective channel diameters of these porins, yielding values ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 nm. Zero-current potential measurements in the presence of salt gradients across lipid bilayer membranes containing individual porins gave results that were consistent with the conclusions drawn from the single-channel experiments. For all porins except protein P, the channels exhibited a greater cation selectivity for less mobile anions and a greater anion selectivity for less mobile cations, which again indicated that the ions were moving inside the pores in a fashion similar to their movement in the aqueous phase. Three porins, PhoE and NmpC of E. coli and protein P of P. aeruginosa, formed anion-selective pores. PhoE and NmpC were only weakly anion selective, and their selectivity was dependent on the mobility of the ions. In contrast, cations were unable to enter the selectivity filter of the protein P channel. This resulted in a high anion selectivity for all salts tested in this study. The other porins examined, including all of the known constitutive porins of the four gram-negative bacteria studied, were cation selective with a 3- to 40-fold preference for K+ ions over Cl- ions.},
