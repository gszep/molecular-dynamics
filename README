2. research-project-assignment -> it contains all the raw data of molecular dynamics
   			       	  simulations you are supposed to analyse

   2.1 umbrella-sampling-data -> it contains two directories (one for each system)
       			      	 with the raw data of umbrella sampling simulations

       2.1.1 helix1_pulling_umbrella -> it contains the umbrella sampling simulations
       	     			     	for the peptide having stating conformational state
					in alpha-helix

       2.1.2 hairpin1_pulling_umbrella -> it contains the umbrella sampling simulations
                                          for the peptide having stating conformational state
				       	  in beta-hairpin 
   
   2.2 md-electric-field-data -> it contains three directories with the raw data of non equilibrium
       			      	 molecular dynamics simulations with different applied voltages
				 across the box simulation

       2.2.1 100mV -> simulations with applied voltage of +/- 100 mV

       2.2.2 200mV -> simulations with applied voltage of +/- 200 mV

       2.2.3 1000mV -> simulations with applied voltage of +/- 1000 mV

##############################################################

1. In every directory you will find files called
   100ns-prot.dcd
   200ns-prot.dcd
   300ns-prot.dcd
   ...
   100, 200 and 300 are labels of the different replicas ran by Prof. Ceccarelli and collaborators having
   the following meaning
   100 -> 1st replica
   200 -> 2nd replica
   300 -> 3rd replica and so on

2. In every directory with the data of non-equilibrium MD simulations with applied voltage there are the following
   executables:

   1. script-ions
   2. script-flux
   3. script-curr

   These executables are supposed to be considered black boxes that do the following:
   1. script-ions
      input: input.idx, 100ns-prot.dcd
      output: 100ns-ions.out
      it reads the dcd file 100ns-prot.dcd and it writes the file with the positions of the ions-> file 100ns-ions.out

   2. script-flux
      input: input.idx, 100ns-ions.out
      output: at screen and files fort.20/21/22/23 with all the time of passage of each ion through the channel
      it reads all the positions of the ions and it analyses the passages of the ions writing as well the average time of passage

   3. script-curr
      input: input.idx, 100ns-ions.out
      output: 100ns-q.out
      it reads the positions of the ions and it writes the charge (passed through the channel) as a function of the time
      The script assumes the voltage is in V (Volt) and the current in A (Ampere) so that you can calculate the conductance in Siemens! 


In the file input.idx you are supposed to change only the first line!
Remember:
100 is just a label that makes the script understanding that is supposed to use the input file 100ns-prot.dcd!!!!!!!!!!

100 -> 1st Replica
200 -> 2nd Replica
300 -> 3rd Replica



Good Luck
